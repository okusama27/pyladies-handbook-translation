# Who to Talk to
    
    
If you’ve faced harassment or witness an event attendee or someone within a PyLadies chatroom, we encourage you to report what you saw to an organizer, chat operator, or whomever is in charge of the space.     
    
    
For instance, if the incident was during a local PyLadies Meetup event, reach out to the organizer(s) of that specific event.     
    
    
If the incident was within the `#pyladies` IRC channel, please privately message the operator of the channel, currently `@roguelynn` (a.k.a. [Lynn Root](lynn%40pyladies.com)).    
    
    
You can also hop into the `#pyladies-support` channel for “live” discussion too.


If you can not find whomever is in charge with the PyLadies space, do not feel comfortable talking to them, or you wish to report a leader:    
    
    
please feel welcome to [email us](coc%40pyladies.com).    
    
    
The following PyLadies organizers are behind the Code of Coduct contact:    
    
    
- [Esther Nam](esthernam%40gmail.com) - Los Angeles

## Harasser has relationship with venue/sponsor
    
    
If the harasser is an employee - or has an established relationship in some way - of the venue host or event sponsor, in addition to contacting a PyLadies leader above in some form, please feel empowered to reach out to the employer or whomever is responsible for the harasser.
